Of course. Let's create a detailed PRD that directly addresses the core problem of fostering community and collaboration in a digital environment, with a strong focus on your "vibe-coding" and aesthetic theme concept.

This PRD is for a new product, a platform designed from the ground up to solve this specific problem.

Product Requirements Document: Project Haven
Product: Haven - An aesthetic, all-in-one digital environment for creative collaboration and community.

Problem Statement: How might we foster a genuine sense of community and facilitate effective peer-to-peer collaboration in a digital environment? Many online platforms feel isolating, and their collaboration tools are often clunky and ineffective.

Vision: To create a digital third place for creative teamsâ€”a space that feels as inspiring and comfortable as a favorite coffee shop or studio, where collaboration is seamless and community flourishes naturally.

1. Introduction & Core Concept
Project Haven is not just a tool; it's an environment. We are building a platform where small teams (students, hackathon groups, indie developers, design studios) can create private, persistent, and highly customizable digital rooms called "Havens."

Each Haven integrates essential collaboration tools (task boards, whiteboards, notes) with seamless communication (chat, voice) and a strong emphasis on shared ambiance and aesthetics. By removing the friction between different apps and creating a shared "vibe," Haven will combat the sense of isolation and make digital collaboration feel more human and engaging.

2. Target Audience
The Hackathon Team: A temporary group of developers and designers who need to rapidly brainstorm, code, and coordinate in a high-pressure environment. They need tools that are fast, integrated, and facilitate quick communication.

The University Project Group: Students in creative or technical fields (design, architecture, computer science) working together over a semester. They need a persistent space to store files, manage tasks, and hold discussions without losing context.

The Indie Creative Duo: A pair of artists, writers, or developers working on a long-term passion project. They need a space that feels personal and inspiring to maintain motivation and a strong collaborative bond.

3. The Core Experience: The "Haven"
A "Haven" is the central building block of the platform. It is a private, invite-only digital space.

3.1. Ambiance & Vibe Customization (The "Style/Theme")
This is the core of the "vibe-coding" experience. The goal is to let teams create a shared sensory environment.

Themes: Each Haven has a customizable theme that dictates the UI's color palette, typography, and icon style.

Examples: "Lo-Fi Cafe," "Cyberpunk Terminal," "Solarpunk Greenhouse," "Minimalist Gallery."

Ambient Soundscapes: The Haven owner can select a shared, looping ambient soundscape for everyone in the room.

Examples: "Rain on a Window," "Quiet Library Murmurs," "Cozy Fireplace," "Synthwave Beats."

Individual users can mute or adjust the volume for themselves.

Interactive Backgrounds: Dynamic, animated backgrounds that subtly react to the time of day or activity within the Haven.

3.2. Integrated Collaboration Suite
These tools are not separate tabs; they are fluid, integrated panels within the Haven itself.

The Canvas: An infinite, real-time collaborative whiteboard for brainstorming, mind-mapping, and mood boarding.

The Scratchpad: A shared, real-time markdown document for meeting notes, project briefs, or collaborative writing.

The Board: A simple, elegant Kanban board for task management (To Do, In Progress, Done). Tasks can be assigned to members and have deadlines.

The Shelf: A simple, visual file storage area for dropping in assets like images, code snippets, and links.

3.3. Seamless Communication Hub
Persistent Chat: A dedicated chat channel for the Haven that saves conversation history. Supports threads and @mentions.

Drop-in Voice Pods: Instead of scheduling calls, a Haven has always-on "Voice Pods." Users can see who is in a pod and simply click to join the conversation. This encourages spontaneous, low-friction communication, mimicking turning your chair to talk to a colleague in a real studio.

4. Community Building Features (Beyond a Single Haven)
The Showcase: A public profile for a team or individual where they can "pin" completed projects from their Havens. This builds a portfolio and a sense of shared accomplishment.

The Discovery Hub: A public space where users can find and join communities centered around specific interests (e.g., "Game Dev Guild," "UI/UX Designers League"). These larger communities can host events and create public, read-only Havens to share resources.

Profiles & Status: User profiles show their skills, projects they've showcased, and a status that reflects what they're doing (e.g., "Brainstorming in 'Project Phoenix' Haven," "Looking for a team for a hackathon").

5. User Stories
As a design student, I want to invite my team to a Haven with a "Minimalist Gallery" theme so that our project space feels clean, professional, and inspiring while we work on our portfolio.

As a hackathon participant, I want to jump into a Voice Pod with my programmer instantly so that we can debug a critical issue without the hassle of setting up a Zoom call.

As an indie developer, I want to see all our team's tasks, notes, and concept art on one seamless screen so that we don't have to constantly switch between Trello, Google Docs, and Discord.

As a new user, I want to browse the Discovery Hub so that I can find a community of writers and potentially find a partner for my next project.

6. Success Metrics
Engagement: Average session duration within a Haven.

Collaboration: Number of active Havens created per week; daily active usage of the Canvas, Board, and Scratchpad features.
