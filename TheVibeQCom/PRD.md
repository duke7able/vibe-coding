Delivery SLA: A 2-hour delivery window is the target for 95% of orders within the launch city.
Baseline Stockout Rate: Assumed industry average of 15% for this product category.
Target Stockout Reduction: 50% reduction (to <7.5%) within 90 days of launch.

A. Executive Summary


1.1 Product Elevator

Project Vibe is a mobile-first Q-commerce platform that delivers curated home décor and lifestyle products in under two hours, powered by an AI engine that predicts demand, personalizes recommendations, and optimizes delivery routes. We drive industry-leading engagement through "Vibe-Code," an integrated productivity game where users achieve personal goals to outpace a customizable AI rival, creating a virtuous cycle of self-improvement and curated consumption.

1.2 Primary User Problems

The product addresses two distinct but interconnected problems in the Indian market:
The Q-Commerce Problem: The Indian quick commerce market, while growing rapidly at a projected CAGR of over 25% 1, is maturing beyond groceries. Consumers seeking non-essential items like home décor and lifestyle products are underserved. They face frequent stockouts, irrelevant product recommendations that fail to capture personal aesthetic, and unreliable delivery windows from existing platforms.3 Concurrently, vendors and micro-retailers struggle with the high operational costs and logistical complexities of real-time inventory management and last-mile fulfillment, which hinders their ability to compete.5
The Engagement Problem: Traditional e-commerce applications suffer from low user retention and high churn, forcing reliance on expensive performance marketing to drive transactions. For the target demographic of tech-savvy urban millennials and Gen Z, a purely transactional app fails to build a lasting habit.7 These users seek digital experiences that provide continuous value, align with goals of self-improvement, and integrate into their daily routines in a meaningful way.9

1.3 MVP Objective & Success Criteria

The primary objective of this MVP is to validate the core hypothesis: that the synergy between an AI-optimized Q-commerce service and a novel gamified productivity layer can create a defensible moat by simultaneously solving key operational inefficiencies and driving superior user engagement. Success will be measured against the following time-bound, measurable goals for the initial Bengaluru launch.

B. Goals & Metrics


2.1 Business Goals

Operational Efficiency: Reduce stockouts for the top 100 SKUs by 50% (from a 15% baseline) within 90 days of launch.
Service Reliability: Achieve an on-time delivery rate (within the 2-hour SLA) of 95% within 60 days.
User Retention: Attain a Day-30 user retention rate of 20%, primarily driven by the Vibe-Code engagement loop.
Revenue Growth: Increase Average Order Value (AOV) by 15% through superior AI-powered recommendations compared to a non-personalized baseline control group.

2.2 North Star Metric & Supporting KPIs

The North Star Metric is chosen to encapsulate the unique synergy between the platform's two core value propositions: engagement and commerce.
North Star Metric: Number of Vibe-Code tasks completed that result in a Q-commerce purchase within 7 days.
Supporting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Q-Commerce KPIs:
Order Frequency: Average number of orders per active user per month.
Cart Conversion Rate: Percentage of sessions with an "add to cart" event that result in a completed purchase.
Average Delivery Time: Mean time from order confirmation to delivery confirmation.
Order Fulfillment Accuracy: Percentage of orders delivered with no errors (wrong item, missing item).
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Predicted net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.
Vibe-Code KPIs:
Daily Active Users (DAU): Number of unique users engaging with the Vibe-Code feature daily.
Task Creation Rate: Average number of new tasks created per user per day.
Task Completion Rate: Percentage of created tasks marked as "complete."
Rival Interaction Frequency: Number of times a user views the rival screen or receives a rival-related notification per week.
Leaderboard Engagement Rate: Percentage of active users who view the leaderboard at least once per week.
AI Model KPIs:
Demand Forecast Accuracy: Measured by Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) between predicted and actual sales. Target MAPE < 20%.
Recommendation Click-Through Rate (CTR): Clicks on recommended products / Impressions of recommended products.
Route Optimization Savings: Percentage reduction in total distance traveled and time taken per delivery batch compared to a non-optimized baseline (e.g., nearest-neighbor heuristic).
The Indian Q-commerce market is undergoing a critical shift from prioritizing hyper-growth to focusing on monetization and operational efficiency.11 This pivot means that unit economics are paramount. Therefore, the AI systems are not merely user-facing enhancements; they are fundamental cost-control mechanisms. Accurate demand forecasting directly reduces inventory holding costs and lost revenue from stockouts, while dynamic route optimization minimizes fuel and labor costs—the largest operational expenditures in last-mile logistics.5 Success will be measured not just by delivery speed but by a steady reduction in the
Cost Per Delivery.

2.3 Operational SLAs

Delivery Window: 95% of orders must be delivered within 2 hours of confirmation. 80% should target a 90-minute window.
Inventory Sync Latency: Maximum 5-minute latency between a stock level change (sale, return, restock) and its reflection across all systems (Vendor Portal, Customer App, AI Models). This is critical to prevent overselling.13
API Latency: The 95th percentile (P95) latency for all user-facing API endpoints, especially Recommendation and Order Placement, must be below 300ms.

D. User Journeys & Flows


4.1 Customer Purchase + Delivery Flow (Priya)

Discovery: Priya opens the app. The home screen features a "Styled for You" carousel, which she scrolls through. She taps the search bar and types "ceramic planter." The intelligent search auto-suggests popular styles.
Evaluation: On the product detail page (PDP) for a planter, she sees high-res images, dimensions, and a delivery ETA of "by 8:45 PM tonight." Below, a "Complete the Look" carousel, powered by the recommendation engine, shows a matching tray and a small succulent. She adds the planter and the tray to her cart.
Checkout: She proceeds to checkout. Her address and preferred payment method (UPI) are pre-filled. She confirms the order with a single tap.
Tracking: She immediately receives a push notification: "Your order is confirmed!" A few minutes later, another notification arrives: "Sunil is on his way to pick up your order." She taps it to open a live map view showing the delivery partner's icon moving towards her location, with a real-time ETA.
Delivery: Sunil arrives. Priya receives her items. The app sends a final notification prompting her to rate the experience.

4.2 Vendor Inventory & Listing Flow (Anika)

Onboarding: Anika signs up on the Project Vibe vendor web portal. She uploads her GST certificate and bank details for verification.
Listing: She downloads the CSV template for product uploads. She fills it out with SKUs, product names, descriptions, prices, and initial stock counts for 20 of her best-selling items and uploads it. The products appear in her dashboard as "Pending Review."
Activation: The Ops team approves her listings. Her products are now live on the app.
Real-Time Sync: A customer buys a vase in her physical store. Anika immediately logs into the portal, searches for the vase SKU, and decrements the stock count from 5 to 4. The change is reflected on the customer app within a minute.
Order Fulfillment: She receives an email and a dashboard notification for a new online order. Her staff packs the items and clicks "Mark as Ready for Pickup." The system automatically assigns a delivery partner.
Handover: Sunil arrives and presents a QR code on his app. Anika's staff scans it with a simple barcode scanner (or phone camera), which confirms the handover in the system.

4.3 Delivery Partner Flow (Sunil)

Start Shift: Sunil opens the Vibe Driver app and toggles his status to "Online." He is now available to receive orders.
Assignment: He receives a notification for a new batched task. The routing engine has combined two orders. The app displays the optimal sequence: 1. Pickup from Anika's Boutique (Mumbai). 2. Deliver to Customer A. 3. Deliver to Customer B.
Navigation: He accepts the task and taps "Navigate to Pickup." The app opens an integrated map interface with turn-by-turn directions.
Pickup & Delivery: At Anika's boutique, he shows the QR code for a secure handover. At each customer's location, he marks the order as "Delivered" and has the option to take a photo as proof of delivery.
Completion: After the final drop-off, the task is marked complete. His earnings for the batch are instantly credited to his in-app wallet.

4.4 Vibe-Code Flow (Rohan)

Onboarding: On his first use of the Vibe-Code tab, Rohan is prompted to create his rival. He names him "SynthSlayer," chooses a futuristic avatar, and selects the "Snarky" personality.
Task Creation: He taps the '+' button and adds a task: "Debug the payment gateway module." He sets the difficulty to "Hard" (worth 500 XP) and sets a deadline for 5 PM today. He adds another task: "30-minute workout," difficulty "Medium" (300 XP), deadline 7 PM.
Tracking & Completion: At 4:30 PM, he finishes debugging and marks the first task complete. A celebratory animation plays, showing +500 XP! and his XP bar filling up.
Failure & Rival Interaction: He gets engrossed in a movie and forgets his workout. At 7:01 PM, he receives a push notification with the "Snarky" personality: "While you were testing the couch's structural integrity, SynthSlayer just banked an easy 300 XP. Getting stronger by the minute!"
Leaderboard: Curious, he opens the Vibe-Code dashboard. He sees his rival's XP has increased. He taps on the "Weekly Leaderboard" and sees he's in 2nd place among his friends, just 150 XP behind the leader. This motivates him to add and complete a small task before bed to try and reclaim the top spot.

5.2 Core Feature Specifications


5.2.1 AI-Powered Recommendations

Purpose: To solve the product discovery problem for users like Priya, increasing cart size, conversion rate, and overall user satisfaction.
User Story: "As a user (Priya), I want to see products that are relevant to my tastes on the homepage and product pages, so I can easily find new items I'll love without having to search extensively."
Acceptance Criteria:
The home screen must contain a horizontally-scrolling carousel titled "Styled for You" that is populated by the Recommendation API.
Each Product Detail Page (PDP) must contain a carousel titled "You Might Also Like" showing items similar to the one being viewed.
The cart screen must contain a carousel titled "Frequently Bought Together" suggesting complementary items.
For new users with no interaction history, all carousels must gracefully fall back to displaying a "Trending in Your Area" list, which is a non-personalized, rule-based ranking. This ensures no user sees an empty state.18
The P99 latency of the recommendation API endpoint must be less than 300ms.
UX Notes:
Headlines should be clear and persuasive (e.g., "Complete your look," "Customers also bought").19
Each recommended item card must have a clear image, price, and a one-tap "Add to Cart" button to reduce friction.19

5.2.2 Vibe-Code AI Rival System

Purpose: To create a powerful, persistent motivational hook that drives daily engagement and habit formation through the psychological principles of loss aversion and narrative progression.
User Story: "As a user (Rohan), when I fail to complete a task by its deadline, I want my personalized AI rival to gain the experience points I missed, so I feel a tangible sense of consequence and am motivated to stay on track."
Acceptance Criteria:
During Vibe-Code onboarding, the user must be prompted to create a rival by providing a name and selecting an avatar from a predefined set.
When a task's deadline passes and its status is not "complete," the XP value associated with that task must be added to the rival's total XP in the xp_ledger table.
The user must receive a push notification within 5 minutes of the deadline passing, informing them that their rival has gained XP. The content of the notification should reflect the rival's chosen personality.
The rival's avatar on the Vibe-Code dashboard should visually update (e.g., glow, level-up animation) when they gain XP.
The rival's level must increase based on a predefined, non-linear XP curve (e.g., Level 2 at 1000 XP, Level 3 at 2500 XP, etc.).
UX Notes:
The rival gaining XP should trigger a distinct, slightly "taunting" animation and sound effect, contrasting with the celebratory feedback for the user gaining XP. This reinforces the loss aversion mechanic.20
The rival's screen should maintain a log of how it earned XP (e.g., "+300 XP from your missed '30-minute workout' task"). This creates a personal narrative of the user's own procrastination.

5.3 Data & Privacy Considerations

Compliance: The application must be fully compliant with India's Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023.22
Consent: During onboarding, a clear, itemized consent screen must be presented. Users must provide "free, specific, informed, unconditional and unambiguous" consent for the processing of their personal data for specific purposes, such as:
Processing order and address data for fulfillment.
Processing browsing and purchase history for personalized recommendations.
Processing location data (only during active delivery) for order tracking.
Data Security: All Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+). Access to production data will be strictly limited to authorized personnel via role-based access control (RBAC).

6.1 Minimal Dataset & Offline Training Plan

The platform faces a critical "cold start" problem with no initial data. The following phased approach will be used to bootstrap the AI models.
Phase 1 (Pre-Launch):
Data Acquisition: Procure anonymized sales data for similar home décor categories in the target city from a market research provider. This will be used to build and test the initial architecture of the demand forecasting model.
Recommender: The initial recommender will be purely rule-based (e.g., "Bestsellers," "New Arrivals").
Phase 2 (Launch - Day 0 to 30):
Data Collection: Log every user interaction: product views, add-to-carts, purchases, search queries, session duration. Log all order and delivery data: timestamps, locations, delivery times.
Model State: The recommender remains in rule-based fallback mode. The routing engine uses a simple heuristic (e.g., batching orders by geographic proximity).
Phase 3 (Day 31 Onwards):
First Training: Use the collected 30 days of data to train the first version of the collaborative filtering recommendation model and the time-series demand forecasting model. The data sparsity will be high, but it provides a baseline.29
Deployment: Deploy the v1 models in "shadow mode" for one week, comparing their predictions against the baseline. If performance is acceptable, switch to live deployment.

6.2 Monitoring & Fallback Logic

Recommender: A circuit breaker pattern will be implemented. If the recommendation service API call exceeds a 300ms timeout or returns an error, the client application will automatically call a static fallback endpoint that returns a curated list of global bestsellers. This ensures system resilience and prevents a poor user experience.
Routing Optimizer: If the optimization service fails to generate a route within the 5-second SLA, the system will fall back to a simple assignment logic (assigning the closest available driver to the oldest pending order) and alert the on-call operations team.
Model Degradation: Model performance will be tracked daily. A model is considered degraded if its primary metric (e.g., MAPE for demand, CTR for recommendations) drops by more than 15% from its post-training baseline. A degraded model will trigger an automated alert for the data science team to investigate and schedule a retraining cycle.30

G. Technical Architecture (MVP Scale)

A microservices architecture is mandated from the outset. While a monolith can be faster for initial development, the distinct operational loads of Q-commerce functions (e.g., high-concurrency writes for inventory, intense periodic computation for routing, high reads for catalog) make independent scaling essential for cost-efficiency and stability.31

7.1 Components and Data Flows

Clients:
Customer App (React Native): Single codebase for iOS and Android to maximize MVP development speed.
Driver App (Native Android): Native for MVP to ensure maximum reliability and access to background location services.
Vendor Portal (React): Web-based dashboard for administrative tasks.
API Gateway: A single, unified entry point (e.g., using Amazon API Gateway or Kong) that handles authentication, rate limiting, and routing of requests to the appropriate downstream microservices.
Core Microservices:
User Service: Manages user profiles, authentication (JWTs), and Vibe-Code user data. (Node.js, PostgreSQL)
Catalog Service: Manages product information, categories, and search indexing. (Node.js, MongoDB/Elasticsearch)
Inventory Service: Manages real-time stock levels with high transactional integrity. This is a critical, high-concurrency service. (Go, PostgreSQL with Redis for caching)
Order Service: Orchestrates the order lifecycle from placement to completion. (Node.js, PostgreSQL)
Vibe-Code Service: Manages tasks, XP ledger, rival logic, and leaderboards. (Node.js, PostgreSQL)
AI/ML Microservices:
Recommendation Service: Exposes an API to serve product recommendations. (Python, FastAPI, Scikit-learn/PyTorch)
Demand Prediction Service: Runs batch jobs to generate forecasts. (Python, FastAPI, Prophet/TensorFlow)
Routing Service: Exposes an API to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). (Python, FastAPI, Google OR-Tools)
Infrastructure & Data Layer:
Message Queue (RabbitMQ): For asynchronous communication between services (e.g., order_placed event triggers inventory update and notification).
Caching (Redis): For session management, real-time inventory counts, and leaderboard data.
Databases: PostgreSQL for services requiring strong transactional consistency (Orders, Inventory, Users). MongoDB or a similar NoSQL store could be used for the flexible product catalog.
Cloud Provider: AWS or GCP, utilizing managed services like RDS, S3, and EKS/GKE for container orchestration.
Data Flow Example (Order Placement):
Customer App sends POST /orders request to API Gateway.
Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the Order Service.
Order Service creates an order entry in its PostgreSQL DB and publishes an ORDER_CREATED event to RabbitMQ.
The Inventory Service consumes this event, decrements the stock for the ordered SKUs, and publishes an INVENTORY_UPDATED event.
The Recommendation Service and Analytics systems consume these events to update their feature stores and dashboards.

H. UX / UI Guidance


8.1 Key Screens and States

Home Screen: A dynamic, personalized dashboard. The top third should feature a prominent Vibe-Code summary: today's XP goal progress bar, rival's current status, and a shortcut to the task list. The rest of the screen is a vertical feed of product carousels ("Styled for You," "New Arrivals," "Trending").
Product Detail Page (PDP): Must feature large, high-quality images. Above the fold, display the product name, price, and a dynamically calculated, specific delivery promise (e.g., "Get it between 7:30 PM - 8:00 PM").
Order Tracking: A full-screen, map-centric UI. The map should show the user's location, the dark store/vendor location, and the delivery partner's real-time position. A persistent banner at the bottom displays the ETA, driver's name, and a button to call the driver.
Vibe-Code Dashboard: This is the central hub for the gamified layer. It should feature:
A clear, filterable list of tasks (Today, Upcoming, Completed).
A large, visual representation of the user's daily/weekly XP progress.
A smaller widget showing the rival's avatar, name, level, and XP. Tapping this leads to the Rival Screen.
Rival Screen: A dedicated screen that builds the rival's narrative. It shows the rival's avatar prominently, their level and total XP, and a reverse-chronological feed of their recent XP gains, explicitly linking them to the user's missed tasks.

8.2 Gamification UX

Micro-interactions & Feedback: Every key action must have immediate, satisfying feedback.
Task Completion: A "swoosh" sound effect, a burst of confetti, and the XP number animating and adding to the total. Use positive reinforcement.33
Rival Gains XP: A contrasting, "negative" sound (e.g., a low thud), a red glow on the rival's avatar, and the XP number animating towards the rival. This creates a feeling of loss.9
Microcopy: The language should be encouraging, slightly competitive, and on-brand.
Streaks: "You're on a 5-day streak! Unstoppable!"
Rival Notifications: "Heads up! Your rival is only 500 XP behind you."
Progress Visualization: Use progress bars, rings, and streak counters extensively. These are fundamental tools for visualizing progress and motivating continued engagement.35

8.3 Accessibility & Responsiveness

The app must adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. This includes sufficient color contrast, support for screen readers, and tappable targets of adequate size.
The UI must be fully responsive and tested on a range of popular Android device screen sizes and resolutions prevalent in the Indian market.

I. Operations & Logistics


9.1 Vendor Onboarding

A simple, self-service web portal is required for vendors. The flow will be:
Sign-up and submit required documents (GSTIN, PAN, bank account details).
Automated verification process.
Access to the dashboard to upload the product catalog via a provided CSV template.
A mandatory, short, interactive tutorial on the importance of and process for maintaining real-time inventory accuracy. Emphasize that inventory accuracy is a key performance metric for vendors on the platform.

9.2 Delivery Partner Onboarding

An in-app onboarding flow for delivery partners:
Download the Vibe Driver app.
Sign-up with a phone number.
Upload required documents: Driver's License, Vehicle Registration Certificate (RC), Aadhaar Card.
Consent to a third-party background check.
Once verified, the account is activated, and they can start accepting delivery tasks.

9.3 Fallbacks & Exception Handling

Failed Delivery: If a customer is unavailable, the driver app will prompt the partner to call the customer twice. If there is no response, they can mark the delivery as "Failed." The order is then returned to the hub on their next return trip, and the customer is automatically notified to contact support to reschedule (a redelivery fee may apply).
Item Unavailability at Pickup: If a vendor reports an item is out of stock when the driver arrives (due to an inventory sync error), the driver app will allow them to mark the specific item as unavailable. The customer is immediately notified via push and given the option to cancel the entire order or receive the partial order with an automatic refund for the missing item.

J. Security, Privacy & Compliance


10.1 Authentication & Authorization

Authentication: All user sessions (customer, driver, vendor) will be managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) and long-lived refresh tokens (30 days) will be used to enforce security.
Authorization: API endpoints will be protected using a role-based access control (RBAC) model. For example, a user with a "DRIVER" role cannot access vendor-specific endpoints.

10.2 Data Privacy & Consent

DPDP Act Compliance: The platform will adhere strictly to India's DPDP Act.22 A Data Protection Officer (DPO) will be designated.
Consent Management: A dedicated "Privacy Settings" section in the app will allow users to view and manage their consent settings granularly at any time. Revoking consent for a specific purpose (e.g., personalization) must be as easy as giving it.
Data Retention: A data retention policy will be enforced. Order history will be retained, but user PII will be anonymized after 24 months of account inactivity.

10.3 Safety & Location Sharing

Customer and driver safety is paramount. The driver's real-time location will only be shared with the customer after they have picked up that specific customer's order.
Location sharing is automatically disabled the moment the order is marked as "Delivered."
All in-app communication between customer and driver will be routed through a number masking service to protect privacy.

K. The Vibe-Code Game Explained


11.1 What is the game?

Vibe-Code is a single-player productivity game played against a personalized AI opponent. The goal is to build positive real-life habits by completing self-defined tasks to earn Experience Points (XP). Your success directly strengthens your in-game character, while your procrastination empowers your rival, creating a dynamic and personal motivational challenge.

11.2 How do I play?

Set Up: Create your character and customize your AI rival (name, look, personality).
Create Tasks: Add real-life goals (e.g., "Finish project report," "Workout for 30 mins"). Assign each task a difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard which corresponds to a set XP value) and a deadline.
Complete Tasks: As you complete tasks in real life, mark them as "done" in the app before the deadline to earn XP and level up.
Watch the Rival: If you miss a deadline, the XP you would have earned is automatically transferred to your rival, making them stronger and leveling them up.
Compete: Track your progress, maintain streaks for bonus XP, and see how you stack up against friends on the weekly leaderboard.

11.3 What are the patterns?

Daily Loop: The core pattern is a daily cycle of setting tasks in the morning, checking them off during the day, and reviewing your progress against your rival in the evening.
Weekly Rhythm: The leaderboard resets every Monday at midnight, creating a weekly competitive cadence and giving all players a fresh start.
Risk vs. Reward: Players learn to balance their daily task list. Overloading with "Hard" tasks offers high XP rewards but increases the risk of failure, which directly benefits their rival. This encourages realistic goal-setting.

11.4 How do I excel?

Consistency is Key: The most effective strategy is to build and maintain daily streaks. Completing at least one task every day for 7 consecutive days unlocks a significant XP bonus.
Strategic Task Management: Excel by breaking down large goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This creates more opportunities to earn XP and reduces the chance of missing a high-value deadline.
Minimize Rival Gains: The ultimate path to excelling is to starve your rival of XP. This means being disciplined with deadlines. The fear of empowering your rival acts as a powerful motivator to complete tasks you might otherwise postpone.

Technical Architecture Diagram Description

The system is designed as a cloud-native microservices architecture to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and independent deployability of components.
Clients (Frontend): The system serves three distinct clients: a Customer Mobile App (React Native), a Driver App (Native Android for MVP), and a Vendor Web Portal (React). All clients communicate exclusively with the backend via a single API Gateway.
API Gateway: This acts as the central entry point, handling request routing, authentication (validating JWTs), rate limiting, and aggregating data from multiple services. It provides a unified and secure interface to the outside world.
Backend Services (Microservices):
Core Services (Node.js/Go): A set of independent services handle core business logic: User Service (auth, profiles), Catalog Service (products), Inventory Service (real-time stock), Order Service (lifecycle orchestration), and Vibe-Code Service (gamification logic). Each service owns its own database to ensure loose coupling.
AI Services (Python/FastAPI): Specialized services for computationally intensive tasks: Recommendation Service (provides personalized product lists), Demand Prediction Service (runs batch forecasting jobs), and Routing Service (solves the VRP for delivery assignments).
Data & Communication Layer:
Databases: A polyglot persistence approach is used. PostgreSQL provides transactional integrity for Orders, Users, and Inventory. Redis is used for high-speed caching of sessions, leaderboards, and hot inventory items. Elasticsearch (managed by the Catalog Service) powers fast, text-based product search.
Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka): An asynchronous messaging backbone decouples services. For example, when an order is placed, the Order Service publishes an ORDER_CREATED event. The Inventory Service, Notification Service, and Analytics systems subscribe to this event to perform their respective tasks without creating a direct dependency, enhancing system resilience.
Data Flow (Simplified): User requests hit the API Gateway, which routes them to the appropriate Core Service. The service processes the request, interacts with its Database, and may publish an event to the Message Queue. Other services, including the AI Services which continuously update their models from this stream of events, consume these messages to trigger subsequent workflows.

Vibe-Code Game Questions


What is the game?

Vibe-Code is a single-player productivity game played against a personalized AI opponent. The goal is to build positive real-life habits by completing self-defined tasks to earn Experience Points (XP). Your success directly strengthens your in-game character, while your procrastination empowers your rival, creating a dynamic and personal motivational challenge.

How do I play?

Set Up: Create your character and customize your AI rival (name, look, personality).
Create Tasks: Add real-life goals (e.g., "Finish project report," "Workout for 30 mins"). Assign each task a difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard which corresponds to a set XP value) and a deadline.
Complete Tasks: As you complete tasks in real life, mark them as "done" in the app before the deadline to earn XP and level up.
Watch the Rival: If you miss a deadline, the XP you would have earned is automatically transferred to your rival, making them stronger and leveling them up.
Compete: Track your progress, maintain streaks for bonus XP, and see how you stack up against friends on the weekly leaderboard.

What are the patterns?

Daily Loop: The core pattern is a daily cycle of setting tasks in the morning, checking them off during the day, and reviewing your progress against your rival in the evening.
Weekly Rhythm: The leaderboard resets every Monday at midnight, creating a weekly competitive cadence and giving all players a fresh start.
Risk vs. Reward: Players learn to balance their daily task list. Overloading with "Hard" tasks offers high XP rewards but increases the risk of failure, which directly benefits their rival. This encourages realistic goal-setting.

How do I excel?

Consistency is Key: The most effective strategy is to build and maintain daily streaks. Completing at least one task every day for 7 consecutive days unlocks a significant XP bonus.
Strategic Task Management: Excel by breaking down large goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This creates more opportunities to earn XP and reduces the chance of missing a high-value deadline.
Minimize Rival Gains: The ultimate path to excelling is to starve your rival of XP. This means being disciplined with deadlines. The fear of empowering your rival acts as a powerful motivator to complete tasks you might otherwise postpone.
